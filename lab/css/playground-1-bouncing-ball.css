   PLAYGROUND 1: THE BOUNCING BALL
   ===================================================
   
   Welcome to your first CSS animation! In this playground,
   you'll learn how to create animations using @keyframes.
   
   🎯 LEARNING GOALS:
   - Understand @keyframes syntax
   - Learn the animation property
   - Practice with transform: translateY()
   - Control animation timing and repetition
   
   📝 INSTRUCTIONS:
   Follow the steps below. When you see TODO comments,
   that's where you need to make changes!
   
   ================================================= */

/* STEP 1: First, let's style our ball
   ================================== */

.bouncing-ball {
  /* Make it look like a ball */
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b, #ee5a24);
  border-radius: 50%; /* This makes it circular */

  /* Add some visual polish */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.3);

  /* TODO #1: Uncomment the line below to apply the animation */
  animation: bounce 2s ease-out infinite;
}

/* STEP 2: Understanding @keyframes
   ================================
   
   @keyframes is how we define what should happen during an animation.
   Think of it like a timeline:
   - 0% = beginning of animation
   - 50% = middle of animation  
   - 100% = end of animation
   
   We can also use "from" and "to" instead of percentages for simple animations.
*/

@keyframes bounce {
  /* At the start (0%), the ball is at the bottom */
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0px);
    /* translateY moves things up (-) or down (+) */
  }

  /* At the middle (50%), the ball is at the top */
  50% {
    /* TODO #2: Fill in the translateY value to move the ball up 100px */
    transform: translateY(-100px);
  }

  /* At the end (100%), the ball returns to the bottom */
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0px);
  }
}

/* STEP 3: Animation Property Breakdown
   ===================================
   
   The animation property is actually a shorthand for several properties:
   
   animation: name duration timing-function iteration-count;
   
   Let's break down "bounce 2s ease-in-out infinite":
   - bounce = name of our @keyframes
   - 2s = duration (how long one cycle takes)
   - ease-in-out = timing function (how the speed changes)
   - infinite = how many times to repeat
   
   OTHER TIMING OPTIONS YOU CAN TRY:
   - linear (constant speed)
   - ease (default - slow start, fast middle, slow end)
   - ease-in (slow start)
   - ease-out (slow end)
   - ease-in-out (slow start and end)
*/

/* EXPERIMENT ZONE! 
   ================
   
   Once you've completed TODO #1 and #2 above, try changing these values:
   
   TODO #3: Change the animation duration
   Try: 1s (fast), 3s (slow), 0.5s (very fast)
   
   TODO #4: Change the timing function
   Try: linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out
   
   TODO #5: Change the number of repetitions
   Try: 1 (bounce once), 3 (bounce 3 times), infinite (never stop)
   
   BONUS CHALLENGE:
   Can you make the ball bounce higher? (Hint: change the translateY value)
   Can you make it bounce sideways too? (Hint: try translateX)
*/

/* STEP 4: Understanding Transform
   ==============================
   
   The transform property is perfect for animations because it:
   - Doesn't affect the layout of other elements
   - Is smooth and performant
   - Can combine multiple transformations
   
   Common transform functions:
   - translateX(50px) = move right 50px
   - translateY(-30px) = move up 30px  
   - scale(1.5) = make 1.5 times bigger
   - rotate(45deg) = rotate 45 degrees
   
   You can combine them:
   transform: translateY(-50px) scale(1.2) rotate(10deg);
*/

/* DEBUGGING TIPS:
   ===============
   
   If your animation isn't working:
   1. Check that you uncommented the animation line in TODO #1
   2. Make sure your @keyframes name matches the animation name
   3. Verify your syntax (don't forget semicolons!)
   4. Check the browser's developer tools for error messages
   
   🎉 CONGRATULATIONS!
   Once your ball is bouncing, you've created your first CSS animation!
   This is the foundation for all the amazing animations you'll build next.
